Welcome to BetterSCAD, a meshless reimplementation of OpenSCAD with
an integrated sclicer. While the name is a bit presumptuous, the idea
is that most of the things that make OpenSCAD crappy stem from its
reliance on meshes, which are not a very natural representation of CSG
objects. BetterSCAD never converts them to meshes: it renders and slices
them directly from their CSG representation.

OpenSCAD (in the F6 mode) spends almost all of its time doing the CSG
operations on large meshes - the actual rendering time once the mesh
is created is fast (it is done on the GPU, and the GPU is very good at
rendering large meshes).

I plan to use raytracing (on the CPU) to render the model wihtout
converting it to a mesh. While it may be hard to achieve interactive
framerates, it should scale to larger models much better than OpenSCAD's
current implementation.

Unfortunately, the popular slicers work on meshes, so as part of this
projcet a slicer will need to be implemented that works directly on the
CSG objects. This is an area with which I am less familiar.
